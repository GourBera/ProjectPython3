Built-in Functions with Tuple

all()     Return True if all elements of the tuple are true (or if the tuple is empty).
any()     Return True if any element of the tuple is true. If the tuple is empty, return False.
enumerate()     Return an enumerate object. It contains the index and value of all the items of tuple as pairs.
len()     Return the length (the number of items) in the tuple.
max()     Return the largest item in the tuple.
min()     Return the smallest item in the tuple
sorted()     Take elements in the tuple and return a new sorted list (does not sort the tuple itself).
sum()     Retrun the sum of all elements in the tuple.
tuple()     Convert an iterable (list, string, set, dictionary) to a tuple.

Python Tuple Methods

count(x)     Return the number of items that is equal to x
index(x)     Return index of first item that is equal to x

my_tuple = ('a','p','p','l','e',)

# Count
# Output: 2
print(my_tuple.count('p'))

# Index
# Output: 3
print(my_tuple.index('l'))
